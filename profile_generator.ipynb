What\\'s your favorite part of being a young person? \\nI like to eat with hot chocolate and to eat with a cold chocolate bar. I know that most of us make it our own...and I like that we are all about making things out of the same recipe. I love the idea of changing the way we make things out of ice cream or ice cream sandwiches or ice cream sandwiches with hot chocolate, and not giving up on making things that are better than what we have right now, right now. I love the idea of making things that are in the right spot, in the right place, and for that I thank Jim. He\\'s a really good friend who will give me everything I need to make things better, and at the same time I am inspired by him and wish him the best of luck in making all the good things. I\\'m always looking forward to hearing what you think. \\nSo if you go to Jim\\'s in New York and have a great time, if you have anything to say, don\\'t be shy. If you can help someone with anything they want to do, be it blogging, or anything else, be sure to follow them there on Facebook and Twitter. Check out their Instagram for an awesome, wide reach site to share your stories. If you want more inspiration, you can follow Jim\\'s on Twitter. '"
