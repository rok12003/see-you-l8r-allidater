Here is a new good match: \\nHi there!\\nYour match is very interesting, as I have been wanting to give an informal answer. Here it is in all its glory: \\nMight you please introduce yourself?\\nMy name is Tom. I am from Ireland, my boyfriend has a big house in England, and I know an interesting world. I don't know a lot about living in the UK, I was hoping to take a year for a college education because I'm afraid that the money from this school will be less than the cost of paying university. The idea was born out of a mutual desire to stay at the same college as myself.\\nI am quite small and I don't have many friends to hang out with (I'm not shy and I find it extremely annoying to talk to other people when I'm studying and when my interests are too busy). Most of the time my relationship with my boyfriend is positive. He is a beautiful young man. We both want to live the beautiful lives our parents did. I think he is the best person to get me the support I need to achieve my dreams. I have also been living with my partner and we've done a lot of work together including a lot of dating. We both agree that we want to make a strong, lasting relationship and hope to take you on a few more adventurous adventures.\\nCan I meet you?\\nWe haven't met in a long time but we have many friends and I know that I may not have the time, energy, and financial resources to meet up with another person at the next meetup in Europe. However, we did meet up for lunch and to hang out as a couple in our house. The other night I asked my boyfriend what he liked most about me and he said 'I think me and his boyfriend have a lot going on.' (laughs)\\nWill you be meeting with any of your coworkers?\\nI am the only other person in my life and am never going to be able to meet with them in person. I am only going to work there occasionally. I also don't even know if I will be able to have an interview with them (laughs). I'd like to have a very brief interaction, for example, that involves trying to get an interview with a guy in some other country. I am not a big fan of dating in the UK, but I do believe that there are a lot of good companies out there that have the right attitude to meet people on the street. My boyfriend is also a very nice guy, he is very friendly, but he would probably never agree to meet with me on the street. I think that he is very curious about me, he would rather be in the back of the car going into the park than go in front of my car. Maybe.\\nHow do you feel about the success in your current field?\\nThis is a very good match: My wife, we both share a dream, we share a beautiful life and we both have been working hard to be a better person. I was looking forward to working with a great new co-founder that i am also excited to work with. I am not sure how to tell the whole story, but I am confident that you will all give me what I need to reach your goals. My job, life, and relationship is as good as it gets.\\nWhen will it end?\\nMy new co-founder is in the building. I feel very proud of him, he is our biggest fan. It is going to be fun to meet the new co-founder and have our own day as we meet new people with the same passion so much.\\nGood luck!\"}]\n"

Top Match 57838: i'm addicted to caffeine. i collect random old photographs. i am a master procrastinator and a pop culture junkie. i love philip marlowe. i am currently going through a knitting phase, although sometimes i prefer to sew or crochet or cross stitch. i enjoy ridiculously cheesy movies. i am usually reading at least two books at the same time, and sometimes more (right now: four).  i have been called snarky by more than one person (by more than two, even).  and i really hate having to describe myself.well, there's work (at a publishing company) and other work (freelance), but then, work is not really what defines a life. so what i'm really doing with my life is a) trying to find my place in the world; and b) trying not to take it all so seriously.  and, you know, watching tv.trivia games. i kill at trivial pursuit, mostly because i have an amazing ability to retain inessential information.  i like to bake, and i'm famous for my bourbon cake and my annual holiday fudge, but i don't really like to cook. because of this, i am very appreciative of other people's cooking.  i am also pretty good at organizing stuff, answering the phone in a professional voice that totally belies my actual manner, and giving the evil eye.my favorite necklace, which i wear pretty frequently, has an oak tree on it. people ask me if it's the oaklandish oak all the time. (it's not)the drive-by truckers, raymond chandler, mary karr, humphrey bogart and audrey hepburn, history, david simon, cheesy musicals and dance movies, bourbon, craftsman architecture, otis redding, abalone jewelry, sweet tea, war movies, dolly parton, the magnetic fields, steel guitars, sandwiches, chuck klosterman, roller derby, the color red, sushi, and many other things.internet, books, diet coke, my music collection, sharpies, and a good sandwich.sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows; travelingeither at home, drinking wine and noodling around (that's a very technical term, yes), or out with friends, doin' stuff that is (marginally) more structured.i have five tattoos. they are neither scandalous nor salacious. Top Match 32305: a large portion of my life is consumed by sarcastic jokes, photography, web design, and over thinking simple situations. the other 10% is spent untangling my headphones, cleaning clothes in my never ending pit of laundry, eating at interesting restaurants, wondering how my phone is always at 14% battery, losing something(mostly my house keys), skyping with the family and last, but not least writing lists of things that describe myself.  creativity is the driving force in my life and it would be great to find someone to share that with!i am working as a designer at a democratic think-tank located in san fransisco. i am also often with my camera at a freelance photo assignment.dreaming big with small pillows. i also would like to think of myself as a decent artist, yes, that is what i would like to be known as, each day i work to become this.that i smile often... always smiling... stop smiling!books usually come in the form of design and photography magazines for me. news from the web.  music: bright eyes, animal collective, ben folds, regina spektor, flight of the conchords, chili peppers, walkmen....  i enjoy any food as long as it is not blue cheese or mushrooms :)friends. family. humor. art. camera. photoshop.what this next big step in my life will bring... moved to san fransisco not having a friend or family base, but so far, so good.with the friends doing something amazingly amazing. relaxing is good too.i pass out often around blood. my most memorable passing out story found me passed out in a barbor's chair halfway through a haircut. i awoke to 3 women trying to get me to eat granola bars.Input: Hey there! I'm Jimmy, but you can call me Jim. \\nI'm a curious soul with a zest for life and a passion for adventure.
