      "so, i went to a dinner party a while ago, and it was filled with a lot of smart people who are doing interesting things, and we talked and laughed about everything and nothing, and it occurred to me that really, that's all i want in life--to be hanging out with smart people who are doing interesting things, and/or to do interesting things with smart people. you can't really go wrong with that, right?  i was born and raised in oregon, but i've been in the bay area for the last 10 years with stops in switzerland and south texas along the way. i originally came here to get a phd at cal, but i quit after 3 semesters to go back to teaching. best decision i ever made. (turns out i like thinking, but what i really like is thinking about something and then doing it.) i like working with children not because they're cute, but because they're interesting.  like most people, i like getting out and doing stuff (drinks, dinner, the beach, hiking, a ball game, music, dancing....), but i'm also cool staying home and lying on the couch sometimes. i always have some sort of creative project going on, usually textile-related. making the world a better place, one impressionable young mind at a time. having ideas. (implementation is less consistent.) cooking breakfast, making 7-layer dip, and baking cookies. playing scrabble, telling stories, navigating. seeing the humor in the situation. being nice to people. recently i was in the parking lot before an a's game, and some gentlemen tailgaters asked me to referee a dispute they were having regarding the correct pronunciation of the president of iran's name. so apparently i look like someone who knows how to pronounce ahmadinejad. maybe it's the glasses. books: complications, david copperfield, mystic river, collapse, the portrait of a lady, the orchid thief. i just finished reading a short history of nearly everything. i read a lot of middle-grades novels for work--some of them are surprisingly well written.  movies: office space. the lives of others. documentaries about everyday people doing their thing. any period costume drama, even the bad ones.  tv: mad men, anything the bbc does. deadwood was the best...so sad it was only on for a few seasons!  music: indie rock, alt-country, bluegrass....but i also love a good pop song. i've recently decided to take up running, and an unexpected side benefit has been rediscovering the joy of listening to a whole album in order instead of on shuffle...today i listened to the ataris. love their version of \"boys of summer.\"  food: homemade macaroni and cheese. (in no particular order) 1. coffee in the morning 2. fresh air 3. music and books (let's just lump the new yorker and npr in there too and call this category \"the liberal media\") 4. hand-knitted socks (seriously, once you try them you'll never go back) 5. laughter 6. i never, ever, would have thought i'd be a person who would say this, but...the internet. ...how fascinating children's minds are and how to get them to learn stuff...how to prevent the impending eco-pocalypse...what knitting project i should start next... titles of books i plan to write someday...whether or not i can sleep 5 extra minutes in the morning trying to rally some co-workers to go to happy hour, out to dinner with friends, reading, or watching netflix. it really depends. i can't stop myself from clicking on links to articles about celebrity divorces. it's like a reflex.  also, the personality tab up there makes it seem like i sit around in my apartment all day with the blinds drawn reading focus on the family pamphlets. i don't do that.\n",
