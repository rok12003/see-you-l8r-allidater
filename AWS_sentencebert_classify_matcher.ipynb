      "i'm intelligent, passionate, funny, active and fun loving. looking for someone who likes to go out but also enjoys staying home for a romantic evening and conversation. that's the big question for all of us.  2012 was the first time i actually wrote out resolutions for myself. last year was a time of big transitions for me. looking happily forward to a year that feels like an exciting new beginning. caring about other people and solving problems. i love figuring out solutions to difficult problems. and cracking jokes. for those that meet me for the first time...the way i half smile with my eyes brightly shining. when i laugh, i have no inhibitions and and am just boisterous. i'm funny, i like cracking jokes...never mean spirited. those that have known for a long time...the way i have become more outgoing and the amount of weight i've lost in the past three years (at least 50 lbs). i love to read, before i moved to my new place and got my kindle, my decor could be described as \"neurotic new york writer.\" books everywhere, i'll read just about anything, borges, milton, crichton, gaitskill, biographies, business books, science..etc  i love all kinds of movies, comedies, dramas like mean girls, out of sight, lost in translation, movies by the coen brothers, kevin smith and cameron crowe. i will confess to the resident evil movies as being a horrible guilty pleasure.  when it comes to tv, i'm probably obsessed with man men, dexter, game of thrones and the wire. also like comedies like community, how i met your mother, absolutely fabulous.  for music, i'll listen to anything rock, rap, opera, dance, club and trance even some country.  food...i love food. i don't eat anywhere nearly as much as i used to, but i'll happily eat anything. french, italian, chinese are my favorite, but my comfort food will always be pb&j. friends and family...even on the worse days, i know there are people out there that always love me.  my iphone, some days the damn thing looks glued to my hand for work, play, texting, movie watching and reading.  books, i love reading. no matter what happens in life, a good book keeps me happy and sane.  computer, i had my first one when i was 12 so i practically grew up on a computer. i think the c:\\ prompt may be written into my genetic code and was even a beta tester for aol's first web browser. no, i'm not that old, i was in college at the time.  my asics running shoes...not the exactly same pair throughout, but those shoes are super comfortable and have seen me through endless miles of running, cycling, basketball, and golf with no foot pain or injury! i've changed my lifestyle to being very active and these shoes have powered me through it.  golf clubs, i promise do not spend hours boring people to death with golf. although, i could if you got me started =d my parents were avid players i dragged me along as a kid and for some reason i picked up the bug as an adult. i love the way it feels when you compress the ball just right...both calming and exhilarating. where life takes me. i feel like there is a good destination for me, but need to keep remembering that the journey is just as if not more important. either having a dinner and drinks, out with friends or relaxing with a nice book or both.. i've pulled all nighters for friends and books. i not know...not too many skeletons in the closet ;)\n",

      "i value honesty, communication, and truth in relationships and seek someone who shares these values. i'm a good listener, patient in all respects and am learning to ask for what i need and to meet my partner's needs as well.  i am open minded. i enjoy new adventures and challenges and am generally not afraid to go beyond my comfort zone.  i am a true pisces. half of my life is spent grounded in the everyday challenges of living, but the other half is spent dreaming with my head in the clouds.  i spend my free time playing nintendo wii, taking pictures and developing them in my darkroom.  i enjoy kayaking on a really warm day in richardson bay.  i hike in the foothills of mt. tam.  i indulge in two to three yoga classes a week.  i travel to europe three or four times a year.  i dream of kayaking with dolphins in baja california. i dream of nuzzling the trunks of wild elephants in india. i dream of sleeping in a beach hut on the coast of thailand. i fantasize holed up for a year in my east coast vacation house writing a book. i envision being curled up with a good book on the top floor of an amsterdam attic, gazing down on the fog-filled serene inner canal, watching people pass and bicyclists pedal, content with being inside, nurtured by a cup of hot chocolate.  i'm addicted to dating. no, not the part where you sit awkwardly together not knowing what to say. the part where you have a chance to connect with someone over dinner, getting to know each other and discovering things about yourself that you never knew, all by listening to the other person.  i am affectionate, worldly, and giving i have an ambition to spend the next year cooking every recipe from julia child's mastering the art of french cooking. oh wait. someone's already done that?! now i don't know what to do with my life. message me with ideas please.  i work and try and have fun along the way! i love to travel, sometimes extravagantly, othertimes not so much. i'm happy camping in the woods, or staying in a mountain inn on top of the world somewhere.  amsterdam is probably my favorite city in the world. there's something incredibly romantic about strolling along the dimly lit canals on a balmy evening in september. i also enjoy spending time in maui, brussels and anywhere in switzerland.  life is short and it's easy to postpone those really big changes until you reach a point where the time has passed you by. i don't want that to happen.  the same is true of relationships. you can't wait for your 'perfect match'. i believe that rather than searching for instant compatibility from the start, people can experience aspects of life together as a starting point toward deepening their relationship. playing bejeweled. (is that valued in the dating community?) spelling and grammar (but not too serious about it). telling you in all honesty you look hot, even on your not-so-hot-days. driving a 5-speed. paying my bills on time, and sadly, paying other people's bills as well. i listen to every word they say. i majored in 19th century literature fan so my favorites book come from that genre:  the brothers karamazov the stranger nicholas nickleby  books i've just read: (november 2011)  everything is illuminated moneyball  i like mystery and suspense movies the best. i love all james bond, alfred hitchcock and anything harry potter.  my favorites movies are: a clockwork orange from russia with love babe the man who knew too much  i just watched the first three seasons of \"breaking bad\" and loved it. pizza, a camera, books, grateful dead, a fast car, dogs. ways to live a full life. dancing and drinking at a club or trying to relax from the work week. i watch nfl football passionately.\n",

      "i am fairly new to the city so most of my free time is spent with jack, my black lab, traipsing around the city checking out new places. we spend a lot of time at fort funston, rodeo beach and gg park, but are always looking for new places to explore. i enjoy anything outdoors whether it be kayaking, camping, hiking or watching a good sports game and the nothing is better than the good company of close friends and family. travelling international and exploring new places locally are prioirties for me the next year or so and i admit i have not done nearly enough. family is also incredibly important to me; i am lucky to have such a large, fun and supportive family. they are the reason i moved back to the bay from boston, although i am begining to really appreciate all the wonderful things ca has to offer.  i would love to meet someone who is open to trying new things, up for an adventure, and down for a good laugh. i don't mind sitting on the couch and relaxing but nine times out of ten if there is something better to do i want to be doing it. currently, i am working at a job i love, planning travels and enjoying whatever comes my way. competitve games. i love a good challenge and play to win. although i hate when it happens, and i like to believe it doesn't happen often, i am a very graceful loser. some games i love to play: pool, fantasy sports, poker, cards, board games, bowling, mini golf (working on the big kid golf), darts.     family, friends, a sunny day, my phone, flip flops, and my dog jack   i can be found grabbing a bite to eat with friends, catching a game at at&t park or having a couple of friends over to bbq in the backyard. .  \n",
