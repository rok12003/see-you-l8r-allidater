listening to music not as albums, but being able to jump between artists, genre\\'s and moods. the things i like are an eclectic mix, although a lot of singer song-writer types. by day its mostly damien rice, mumford and sons, pete murray, elliot smith, etc.. by night, i love to dance so anything pop/hiphop/rap that is currently popular at clubs is fine by me.  reading -- my kindle is a mix
